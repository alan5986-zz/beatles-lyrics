When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
~And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
~Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
~Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
~Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
~I saw a film today, oh, boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
~Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
~Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
~I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
~Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come
~See how they fly like Lucy in the Sky, see how they run
~Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain
~I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus
~Semolina pilchard, climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe
~All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all
~Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
~Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
~Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me
~Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
~Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
~Jai Guru Deva
~Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
~Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
~Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone
~All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
~Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
~Eleanor Rigby died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
~Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
~No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad
~Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
~I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
~I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
~With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
